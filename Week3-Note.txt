Multivariate data
This means more than two variables, each of which is categorical or quantitative data. Ex: Three or more columns. Think about looking at the responses in a table or form.

How to look at the data:

Table of frequencies of each answer from the categorical responses
Table can be two-dimensional. Ex: (Female, HS degree), (Male, HS Degree), Female, College), (Male, College)
Can add a Total column in either direction
Visualize with a bar chart, or side by side bar chart
Mosaic plot shows tiles where size is proportional to number of responses
Looking at associations with multivariate quantitative data
More than one trait with measured numeric values. How to visualize more than one trait

Scatter plot
Can use different colors for different categorical data
Expressing numerically:

Correlation coefficient, ex: the Pearson correlation (R or 
): number from -1 to 1 indicating the strength and sign of association between two variables
Closer to -1 or 1: Strong association
Remember... correlation does not mean causation! Don't forget about confounding variables, which are outside influences that change the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
